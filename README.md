# Golang-Flavored C++ (GFC)

This C++ library helps you to write your C++ code in Go style by providing:

- Go-inspired error handling classes, functions, and macros.

- A 'Result' class to emulate Go's convention of returning
  the error (or nil) as one of the multiple return values.

This a header-only, C++11-compatible library with no additional dependencies,
which makes it trivial to include in your own projects.

## Getting Started

To use this framework in your own project, see the `demo` folder. (COMING SOON)

Also see the `test` folder for unit tests. (COMING SOON)
